				<h2>Welcome to 'Where's The Wax?'</h2>
				<p>
					With the resurgence in popularity of vinyl records more and more record shops are begining to sell them.  
					However, it can be hard to find stores that sell, much less specialize in them.  Where's The Wax? is a great way to locate record 
					shops that sell those collectable plastic discs.  Through our site, you can search for nearby shops using the map,
					or search for shops at other locations.  If you find a shop that is not in our databaee, you can submit it to us and we will add
					it to the list.  Feel free to contact us with any suggestions for the site, or any comments you might have. <br /><br />
					Happy crate digging!
